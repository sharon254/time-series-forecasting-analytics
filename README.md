Time Series Forecasting Analytics

Overview

This project explores a range of time series forecasting techniques to predict future trends using both traditional statistical and modern machine learning methods. The goal is to compare performance across models and understand how each approach balances accuracy, interpretability, and complexity.

The project is part of the Predictive Optimization Analytics coursework and demonstrates practical implementation of ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, Machine Learning, and Neural Network (LSTM) models in Python.

Objective

To implement and evaluate multiple forecasting techniques for time series prediction:

Traditional Methods: ARIMA and SARIMA

Machine Learning Methods: Linear Regression and Random Forest

Probabilistic Model: Facebook Prophet

Neural Network Model: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Each model is trained, tuned, and evaluated to identify the best-performing approach using standard error metrics.

Dataset

Any time series dataset can be used for this project. Common examples include:

Stock price data via the yfinance API

Weather data

Energy consumption data
